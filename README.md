In this homework assignment the following changes were made (from element tags to semantic tags)

The body part of our html file I commited the following changes:

Instead of "div" associated with header I used "Header", inside the same part "div" was replaced with "nav".

The second part of the body "content" instead of "div".

The last part of the body I replaced "div" with "benefits" and "aside" 

At the end instead of div, I used "footer"
